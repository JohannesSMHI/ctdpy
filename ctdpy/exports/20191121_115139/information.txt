Sensors are regularly calibrated, cleaned and stored according to the latest recommendations from the manufacturer. 
Data is processed by the following seabird steps: datcnv, filter, alignctd, celltm, loopedit, derive, binavg and ascii out. These steps with some extra information are available in the data file header.
After processing, the data is plotted and visually quality controlled in MATLAB and possible errors are flagged as bad.
